                    HTML stands for HyperText Markup
                    Language. It is used to design
                    web pages using a markup language.
                    HTML is the combination of Hypertext
                    and Markup language. Hypertext
                    defines the link between the web
                    pages. A markup language is used
                    to define the text document within
                    tag which defines the structure of
                    web pages. HTML is a markup language
                    that is used by the browser to
                    manipulate text, images, and other
                    content to display it in the required
                    format.

                    C is a procedural programming language.
                    It was initially developed by Dennis
                    Ritchie as a system programming
                    language to write operating system.
                    The main features of C language include
                    low-level access to memory, simple set
                    of keywords, and clean style, these
                    features make C language suitable for
                    system programming like operating system
                    or compiler development.

                Node.js (Node) is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. Node
                is used extensively for server-side programming, making it possible for developers to use JavaScript for
                client-side and server-side code without needing to learn an additional language. Node is sometimes
                referred to as a programming language or software development framework, but neither is true; it is
                strictly a JavaScript runtime.

                Node incorporates the V8 JavaScript engine, the same one used in Google Chrome and other browsers. It is
                written in C++ and can run on macOS, Linux, Windows and other systems. The engine parses and executes
                JavaScript code. It can operate independently of a browser environment, either embedded in a C++
                application or implemented as a standalone program. The V8 engine compiles JavaScript internally, using
                just-in-time (JIT) processes to speed up execution.

                The following code is an example of a simple JavaScript file (server_tst.js) written for the Node
                environment. The script starts by loading the Node.js Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) module. The
                module includes a variety of classes and methods for implementing an HTTP server.
